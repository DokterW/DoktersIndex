# Dokter's Index

This is a very simple and crude file manager that started out as a test. I needed a simple file manager for my [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) bash shell script, [LazyGit](https://github.com/DokterW/LazyGit).

All you can do is to move up and down in your folders.

If I find the time I might add some extra features later.
